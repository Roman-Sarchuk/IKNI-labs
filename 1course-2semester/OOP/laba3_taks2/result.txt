History of Computers
	It is very difficult to find the exact origin of computers. 
But according to some experts computer exists at the time of world war-II. 
Also, at that time they were used for keeping data. 
But, it was for only government use and not for public use. 
Above all, in the beginning, the computer was a very large and heavy machine.
Working of a Computer 
	The computer runs on a three-step cycle namely input, process, and output. 
Also, the computer follows this cycle in every process it was asked to do. 
In simple words, the process can be explained in this way. 
The data which we feed into the computer is input, the work CPU (Central Processing Unit) do is process and the result which the computer give is output.

	There was, some time ago, a gentleman who was very rich. He had fine town and country houses, his dishes and plates 
were all of gold or silver, his rooms were hung with damask, his chairs and sofas were covered with the richest silks, 
and his carriages were all gilt with gold in a grand style. But it happened that this gentleman had a blue beard, which 
made him so very frightful and ugly, that none of the ladies, in the parts where he lived, would venture to go into his 
company. Now there was a certain lady of rank, who lived very near him, and had two daughters, both of them of very great 
beauty. Blue Beard asked her to bestow one of them upon him for a wife, and left it to herself to choose which of the two 
it should be. But both the young ladies again and again said they would never marry Blue Beard; yet, to be as civil as 
they could, each of them said, the only reason why she would not have him was, because she was loath to hinder her sister 
from the match, which would be such a good one for her. Still the truth of the matter was, they could neither of them bear 
the thoughts of having a husband with a blue beard; and besides, they had heard of his having been married to several wives 
before, and nobody could tell what had ever become of any of them. As Blue Beard wished very much to gain their favour, he 
asked the lady and her daughters, and some ladies who were on a visit at their house, to go with him to one of his country 
seats, where they spent a whole week, during which they passed all their time in nothing but parties for hunting and fishing, 
music, dancing, and feasts. No one even thought of going to bed, and the nights were passed in merry-makings of all kinds. 
In short, the time rolled on in so much pleasure, that the youngest of the two sisters began to think that the beard which 
she had been so much afraid of, was not so very blue, and that the gentleman who owned it was vastly civil and pleasing. Soon 
after their return home, she told her mother that she had no longer any dislike to accept of Blue Beard for her husband; and 
in a very short time they were married.
	About a month after the marriage had taken place, Blue Beard told his wife that he should be forced to leave her for a few weeks, 
as he had some affairs to attend to in the country. He desired her to be sure to indulge herself in every kind of pleasure, to 
invite as many of her friends as she liked, and to treat them with all sorts of dainties, that her time might pass pleasantly till 
he came back again. “Here,” said he, “are the keys of the two large wardrobes. This is the key of the great box that contains the 
best plate, which we use for company, this belongs to my strong box, where I keep my money, and this belongs to the casket, in which 
are all my jewels. Here also is a master-key to all the rooms in the house; but this small key belongs to the closet at the end of 
the long gallery on the ground floor. I give you leave,” said he, “to open, or to do what you like with all the rest except this closet. 
This, my dear, you must not enter, nor even put the key into the lock, for all the world. If you do not obey me in this one thing, you 
must expect the most dreadful punishments.” She promised to obey his orders in the most faithful manner; and Blue Beard, after kissing 
her tenderly, stepped into his coach, and drove away.
	When Blue Beard was gone, the friends of his wife did not wait to be asked, so eager were they to see all the riches and fine things 
she had gained by marriage; for they had none of them gone to the wedding, on account of their dislike to the blue beard of the bridegroom. 
As soon as ever they came to the house, they ran about from room to room, from closet to closet, and then from wardrobe to wardrobe, 
looking into each with wonder and delight, and said, that every fresh one they came to, was richer and finer than what they had seen 
the moment before. At last they came to the drawing-rooms, where their surprise was made still greater by the costly grandeur of the 
hangings, the sofas, the chairs, carpets, tables, sideboards, and looking-glasses; the frames of these last were silver-gilt, most richly 
adorned, and in the glasses they saw themselves from head to foot. In short, nothing could exceed the richness of what they saw; and they all 
did not fail to admire and envy the good fortune of their friend. But all this time the bride herself was far from thinking about the fine 
speeches they made to her, for she was eager to see what was in the closet her husband had told her not to open. So great, indeed, was her desire 
to do this, that, without once thinking how rude it would be to leave her guests, she slipped away down a private staircase that led to this forbidden 
closet, and in such a hurry, that she was two or three times in danger of falling down stairs and breaking her neck.
	When she reached the door of the closet, she stopped for a few moments to think of the order her husband had given her, and how he had 
told her that he would not fail to keep his word and punish her very severely, if she did not obey him. But she was so very curious to 
know what was inside, that she made up her mind to venture in spite of every thing. She then, with a trembling hand, put the key into 
the lock, and the door straight flew open. As the window shutters were closed, she at first could see nothing; but in a short time she 
saw that the floor was covered with clotted blood, on which the bodies of several dead women were lying.
	These were all the wives whom Blue Beard had married, and killed one after another. At this sight she was ready to sink with fear, 
and the key of the closet door, which she held in her hand, fell on the floor. When she had a little got the better of her fright, 
she took it up, locked the door, and made haste back to her own room, that she might have a little time to get into a humour to amuse 
her company; but this she could not do, so great was her fright at what she had seen. As she found that the key of the closet had 
got stained with blood in falling on the floor, she wiped it two or three times over to clean it; yet still the blood kept on it the 
same as before. She next washed it, but the blood did not move at all. She then scoured it with brick dust, and after with sand, but 
in spite of all she could do, the blood was still there; for the key was a fairy who was Blue Beard’s friend; so that as fast as she 
got off the blood on one side, it came again on the other. Early in the same evening Blue Beard came home, saying, that before he had 
gone far on his journey he was met by a horseman, who was coming to tell him that his affair in the country was settled without his being 
present; upon which his wife said every thing she could think of, to make him believe she was in a transport of joy at his sudden return.
	The next morning he asked her for the keys: she gave them to him; but as she could not help showing her fright, Blue Beard easily guessed 
what had been the matter. “How is it,” said he, “that the key of the closet upon the ground floor is not here?” “Is it not?” said the wife, 
“then I must have left it on my dressing-table.” “Be sure you give it me by and by,” replied Blue Beard. After going a good many times 
backwards and forwards, as if she was looking for the key, she was at last forced to give it to Blue Beard. He looked hard at it, and then 
said: “How came this blood upon the key?” “I am sure I do not know,” replied the poor lady, at the same time turning as white as a sheet. 
“You do not know?” said Blue Beard sternly, “but I know well enough. You have been in the closet on the ground floor! Very well, madam: 
since you are so mighty fond of this closet, you shall be sure to take your place among the ladies you saw there.” His wife, who was almost 
dead with fear, now fell upon her knees, asked his pardon a thousand times for her fault, and begged him to forgive her, looking all the 
time so very mournful and lovely, that she would have melted any heart that was not harder than a rock. But Blue Beard only said, “No, no, 
madam; you shall die this very minute!” “Al	There was, some time ago, a gentleman who was very rich. He had fine town and country houses, his dishes and plates
